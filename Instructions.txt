I am not adding the CSV files in this repo.

This project can be compiled using SBT. Make sure you have SBT installed.
Before compiling, pealse change the paths for the CSV files in the code. Otherwise, I would have provided the JAR file too.

To compile:
sbt compile

Once it compiles, package it as follows:
sbt package

Once you have your jar file ready, you can do a spark-submit like this:
spark-submit --class com.paytm.interview.WeatherChallenge /Users/prakarsh/projects/paytmchallenge/target/scala-2.11/paytmchallenge_2.11-0.1.jar

Of course you need spark installed :)

Thank you!
